# Patrick Bower

I'm a `London` based, `front end developer` with a `design background`. I have a passion for making websites that stand out. I currently working for an `agency for 5 years` using modern technologies and practices to deliver projects for a wide range of clients. Working for well known organisations my goals are for fast, scalable, accessible and eloquent code. Whether embedded in a team or working alone I believe in delivering consistent and quality work. While I currently focus solely on development, my design experience has given me a strong insight into UI/UX. This enables me to contribute ideas and helps me translate design into development.
